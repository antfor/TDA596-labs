How we moved server and proxy to the Cloud

    1. We created docker containers for both the http_serer and the proxy

    2. We stored them on AWS as an Elastic Container Registry

    3. To run them we created an Elastic Container Service
        
        3.1 First we created tasks that used the containers stored in the ECR 

        3.2 Then we created a new cluster for each task

        3.3 We ran the two tasks on the two separate clusters
        
    4. Now it is all on the cloud
